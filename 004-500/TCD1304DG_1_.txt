              If any one of the ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS is exceeded,
              the electrical characteristics, reliability and life time of the device
              cannot be guaranteed. If the ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS are
              exceeded, the device can be permanently damaged or degraded.
              Create a system design in such a manner that any of the
              ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS will not be exceeded under any
              circumstances.

Cautions
   1.    Electrostatic Breakdown
        Store in shorting clip or in conductive foam to avoid electrostatic breakdown.
        CCD Image Sensor is protected against static electricity, but inferior puncture mode device due to static
        electricity is sometimes detected. In handing the device, it is necessary to execute the following static electricity
        preventive measures, in order to prevent the trouble rate increase of the manufacturing system due to static
        electricity.

         a.   Prevent the generation of static electricity due to friction by making the work with bare hands or by putting
              on cotton gloves and non-charging working clothes.
         b.   Discharge the static electricity by providing earth plate or earth wire on the floor, door or stand of the work
              room.
         c.   Ground the tools such as soldering iron, radio cutting pliers of or pincer.
         d.   Ionized air is recommended for discharge when handling CCD image sensors.

        It is not necessarily required to execute all precaution items for static electricity.
        It is all right to mitigate the precautions by confirming that the trouble rate within the prescribed range.

   2.    Window Glass
        The dust and stain on the glass window of the package degrade optical performance of CCD sensor.
        Keep the glass window clean by saturating a cotton swab in alcohol and lightly wiping the surface, and allow the
        glass to dry, by blowing with filtered dry N2. Care should be taken to avoid mechanical or thermal shock because
        the glass window is easily to damage.

   3.    Incident Light
        CCD sensor is sensitive to infrared light. Note that infrared light component degrades resolution and PRNU of
        CCD sensor.

   4.    Mounting on a PCB
        This package is sensitive to mechanical stress.
        TOSHIBA recommends using IC inserters for mounting, instead of using lead forming equipment.
        Since this package is not strong against mechanical stress, you should not reform the lead frame.
        We recommend to use an IC-inserter when you assemble to PCB.

   5.    Soldering
        Soldering by the solder flow method cannot be guaranteed because this method may have deleterious effects
        on prevention of window glass soiling and heat resistance.
        Using a soldering iron, complete soldering within three seconds for lead temperatures of up to 350°C.
